Literature Review

The intersection of natural language processing (NLP), information retrieval, and fact-checking has garnered substantial attention in recent years. As we delve into the existing body of literature, several key themes and contributions emerge that provide a foundation for the "Corpus Fact-Checking Dashboard" project.

1. NLP in Information Retrieval:
Researchers have explored the application of NLP techniques to enhance information retrieval processes. Khurana et al. (2023) present a comprehensive overview of the state of NLP, emphasizing its role in extracting meaningful information from textual data. Leveraging tools such as NLTK and Spacy, these approaches have shown promise in discerning patterns and sentiments from large corpora.

2. Fact-Checking and NLP:
The synergy between NLP and fact-checking has been a subject of interest. Das et al. (2023) specifically focus on human-centered NLP technology for fact-checking. Their work highlights the challenges and advancements in utilizing NLP to verify information, shedding light on the potential of such technologies in addressing misinformation.

3. Text Analysis in Academic Literature:
Text analysis in academic literature has been explored for various purposes. Min et al. (2023) discuss recent advances in NLP through large pre-trained language models. Their survey touches upon the evolving landscape of text analysis, showcasing its relevance in understanding and processing vast amounts of textual information.

4. Automated Dashboard for Fact-Checking:
While various studies discuss NLP and fact-checking independently, there is a noticeable gap in the literature regarding the development of automated dashboards for streamlined fact-checking processes. Capuano et al. (2023) touch upon content-based fake news detection, but a dedicated exploration of dashboards for academic fact-checking is notably absent.

5. Handling Large Corpus:
The challenge of managing extensive corpora, such as those found in PubMed, has been acknowledged. The need for effective storage and retrieval mechanisms is highlighted by Bharadiya (2023), who emphasizes the importance of considering methods for handling large volumes of textual data.

The "Corpus Fact-Checking Dashboard" project is noteworthy because it attempts to fill the hole in the literature by offering a targeted and simple to operate tool for fact-checking inside a particular corpus of scholarly articles. Although NLP, fact-checking, and text analysis are all mentioned in previous works, the integration of these ideas into an interactive dashboard for academic corpus fact-checking is a new development. The project provides a thorough solution for academics and researchers by addressing the real-world issues related to fact-checking and information retrieval in academic settings.

To summarize, the body of research highlights the value of natural language processing (NLP) in information retrieval and fact-checking, which opens doors for creative initiatives like the "Corpus Fact-Checking Dashboard" to meaningfully impact the developing field.

## Methods

### 1. Data Preprocessing

The project began with data preprocessing to prepare the textual content extracted from XML files for efficient searching.

- **Tokenization and Lowercasing:** The NLTK library was used to tokenize the text into words, and all words were converted to lowercase to ensure uniformity.

- **Stopword Removal:** Common English stopwords were removed to focus on meaningful content and enhance search accuracy.

### 2. Searching for Phrases in XML Files

The primary task was to search for user-specified phrases within a directory of XML files.

- **XML Parsing:** The `xml.etree.ElementTree` module facilitated parsing XML files to extract relevant text content.

- **Phrase Matching:** A function was developed to check for the existence of a given phrase in the preprocessed text using exact matching.

### 3. Streamlit User Interface

To make the project accessible and user-friendly, a Streamlit dashboard was implemented.

- **Dashboard Components:** The Streamlit framework was employed to create an interactive dashboard. Key components included:
  - Title display using `st.title`.
  - User input field for queries with `st.text_input`.
  - Button for triggering the fact-checking process with `st.button`.
  - Results display using `st.write`.

### 4. Special Setup Procedures

Specific setup procedures were required to ensure proper execution of the project.

- **NLTK Data Download:** The NLTK datasets ('punkt' and 'stopwords') were downloaded using `nltk.download` to support tokenization and stopwords removal.

- **XML Parsing:** Verification of the presence of necessary XML files in the specified corpus directory (`CORPUS_DIRECTORY`) was crucial for successful execution.

### 5. Source Code Organization

The source code was structured into functions to enhance modularity and readability. Each function had a specific role in the fact-checking process, contributing to code maintainability.

### 6. Running the Artifact

To execute the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure NLTK datasets are available by running `nltk.download('punkt')` and `nltk.download('stopwords')`.

2. Verify the presence of XML files in the specified corpus directory (`CORPUS_DIRECTORY`).

3. Run the script containing the provided code.

The user will interact with the Streamlit dashboard, entering queries for fact-checking and receiving results dynamically.

By following this comprehensive methodology, the project achieved a reliable and replicable framework for fact-checking within a corpus of XML files, with a user-friendly interface provided by the Streamlit dashboard.
